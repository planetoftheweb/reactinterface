React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces that display dynamic data. Because of its reusable components and unique data rendering approach, the web interfaces you create with React are flexible, fast, and lightweight. Need another reason to choose React? It's also easy to learn, with these lessons from staff author Ray Villalobos. Join Ray as he reviews React's component architecture and covers key skills such as handling events, breaking code into custom subcomponents, managing form fields with references, and setting up sorting and search. Every lesson is focused on the specifics of creating web interfaces with React, so you'll be able to easily transition the techniques to your own projects.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage. Or you can simply add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to peek at. 

## Branches
The branches are structured so that they correspond to the videos in the course. So, for example if I name a branch `02_03b` then that branch corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The extra letter at the end of the name corresponds to the state of the branch. A `b` means that this is how the code looks at the beginning of the video, an `e` means that is how the code looked at the end of the video.

You may find additional branches that correspond to other states, so for example, you may see a `t`, which means this is a target branch. A target branch is something I use during development or updates of a course and it's for a branch that I'm working towards. For the purposes of taking a course, you may ignore any additional branches. The `master` branch usually has the state of the project as I'm working through it and the final state of the code when I finish the course.
